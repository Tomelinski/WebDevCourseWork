    <p>
        In this web page I demonstrate a basic understanding of how tables in html work. Also using tables as a page 
        layout to make the web page more organised. I also used tables to making a tag description section, my 
        favourite books section and my second semester schedule.

                    As humanity uses light-speed travel to establish new colonies,
                     Ender and his sister Valentine age slowly through relativistic
                    travel. Ender's older brother, the now-aged Hegemon Peter Wiggin,
                    recognizes Ender's writings in The Hive Queen, and requests Ender
                    write for him once he dies. Ender agrees and authors The Hegemon.

                    French city of Saint-Malo to drive out the remaining Nazi troops.
                    Our two main characters are Marie Laure, a blind French girl who 
                    fled here with her uncle from Paris, and Werner, a radio expert in 
                    the German army who is stuck in the city when the attack begins. We 
                    jump back and forth in time, and between the two charactersâ€™ 
                    perspectives to see how both young people were brought to this place.

                    straightforward, and conversational. He comes across as someone whose 
                    wide-ranging, collaborative experience and creative intelligence combine 
                    with an everyday kind of modesty in a way that allows you to imagine 
                    you could run into him in a club somewhere
